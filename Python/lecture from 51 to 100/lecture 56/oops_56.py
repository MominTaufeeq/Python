#There are two type of programming 1)Procedural programming language 2)Object Oriented Programming language 
#1)Procedural programming mean creating Variable and assing the value 
#2)Oop mean class and Object for real world entity
# The procedure we are following till now is the “Procedural Programming” approach.
# So, in this session, we will learn about Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
#  The basic idea of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python is to use 
# classes and objects to represent real-world concepts and entities.

#For eg:-
# RailwayForm   ---> Class [blueprint]
# harry --> harry ki info wala form --> Object [entity]
# tom --> tom ki info wala form --> Object [entity]
# shubham -- shubham ki info wala form --> Object [entity]
# shubham.changeName("Shubhi")

#Features in Oops
'''1)encapsulation :- It is hidden for eg:- If we are change the name then writting a taufeeq.changeName()
 then the name is change by the class it will be hidden
 *One of the key features of OOP in Python is encapsulation, 
 which means that the internal state of an object is hidden and can only be accessed or modified through the object's methods.
This helps to protect the object's data and prevent it from being modified in unexpected ways.

2)Inheritance :- We can extend in object foreg:-Jub bhi ham purane cheez me  kuch new cheeze add karte hai usko bolte hai inheritance
Another key feature of OOP in Python is inheritance, 
which allows new classes to be created that inherit the properties and methods of an existing class.
 This allows for code reuse and makes it easy to create new classes that have similar functionality to existing classes.'''

'''3)Polymorphism is also supported in Python, which means that objects of different classes can be treated as if they were objects of a common class.
 This allows for greater flexibility in code and makes it easier to write code that can work with multiple types of objects.'''
